# MCTS-TicTacToe
Monte Carlo Tree Search Algorithm based AI Tic Tac Toe Solver
# About
This project aims at devloping a AI game solver for board games. Since tic -tac-toe is a clasical example of board games. We try to implement the Monte Carlo Tree Search Algorithm.
# Monte Carlo Tree Search Algorithm (MCTS)
Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) is a heuristic search algorithm for some kinds of decision processes, most notably those employed in game play. MCTS was introduced in 2006 for computer Go.
# Why MCTS?
For solving board games like tic-tac-toe, genrally algorithms like MinMax are used. This project is a way of trying out techniques to create a AI solver which can be used to play a AI vs Human or AI vs AI game.
# How does MCTS work?

# Working of Code and samples
So, the code working can be shown by the following examples:
